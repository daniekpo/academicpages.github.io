Welcome! I am an undergraduate research assistant at Brigham Young University. I am very interested in visual perception. I want to spend the rest of my life doing research to help autonomous agents make intelligent decisions using the visual data around them.

I'm currently researching under [Ryan Farrell](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~farrell/). I'll be starting a research internship in June and will be doing research with [Abhinav Gubta](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/abhinav-gupta/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

When I'm not doing technical stuff, I love to get people together to play soccer.
