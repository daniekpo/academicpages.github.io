Welcome! I am an undergraduate research assistant at Brigham Young University. I am very interested in visual perception. I want to spend the rest of my life doing research to help autonomous agents make intelligent decisions using the visual data around them.

I'm currently researching under Ryan Farrell. I'll be starting a research internship in June and will be doing research with Abhinav Gubta at Carnegie Mellon University.

When I'm not doing technical stuff, I love to get people together to play soccer.
